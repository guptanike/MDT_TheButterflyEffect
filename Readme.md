# Problem Statement
People often ignore daily micro-decisions such as sleep timing, study duration, or screen usage because they appear insignificant. However, when repeated consistently, these small choices compound over time and lead to major long-term consequences. Currently, there is no simple system that helps individuals visualize how their daily micro-decisions create a butterfly effect on their future.

# Proposed Solution
Micro Decision Taker is a butterfly-effect-based model that allows users to log daily micro-decisions, assigns impact scores to each decision, detects behavioral patterns, and visualizes how repeated small actions compound into long-term outcomes across health, focus, career, and mental well-being.

# Scope & Limitations
  1. Single-user demo system
  2. Rule-based logic (no real predictions but possibilities)
  3. No login / authentication
  4. No medical or psychological claims
  5. Educational & awareness-based model
